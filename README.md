## FAQ

**Q: What if files have no metadata?**  
A: The app can use the file system creation/modification date as a fallback (enable/disable in options).

**Q: Will my files be overwritten?**  
A: No, the app will never overwrite existing files. In case of duplicate names, a number is appended automatically.

**Q: How can I undo a rename operation?**  
A: Click the **Undo last Rename** button to revert the previous batch.
